        <h2>ABOUT DEPT</h2>
        <p class="csed"><br>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology, Visakhapatnam, was established in the year 2002 and provides a perfect academic and research environment complemented by excellence in teaching.
            <br><br>
            The Department offers B.Tech., M.Tech (CSE and SE) Programmes. The Department has a comprehensive curriculum on topics related to all aspects of Computer Science and Engineering with an emphasis on practical learning. The course structure is up-to-date and includes courses on nascent topics to equip our students with the latest developments in Computer Science and Engineering.
            <br><br>
            The Department has state-of-the-art infrastructure and computing equipment supported by high-speed Ethernet and wireless networks. Student organization like ACM Chapter is active throughout the year.
            <br><br>
            Our faculty members aim at delivering top class education, blending their rich research experience with classroom teaching. The Department has undertaken many research projects funded both by government agencies and foreign research society.
            <br><br>
            CSE Department currently has 49 full-time faculty members, some of whom are cross-listed with related departments such as Basic Science, EEE, ECE, Mechanical, etc. We also draw on the expertise of a few Visiting Professors from Foreign Universities and Industry. The Department has UG intake of 240 students. Roughly 80% of these students finally getting jobs in Industries, and 10-15% are going for Master Programmes and Research.

            A warm welcome to CSE@Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology……..
            <br><br>
            CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) at the Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology has its seeds in the erstwhile Institute set up in 2002. While at inception, it was primarily focused on academics, the ambit expanded on the journey to include M.Tech Programmes, Research and Placements, Research Center, and NBA Accreditations (2009 and 2017), leading to the current name.
            <br><br>
            CSE Department focuses on academics, creative research, and good placements in three broad areas of computer science:
            <br><br>
            • Computer Science and Engineering, including basic concepts, number theory, complexity theory, graph theory, coding theory, algorithms, data structures, cryptography and security.
            <br><br>
            • Computer Systems and Software, including computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, software engineering, database systems, graphics and visualization, communication networks, and distributed computing.
            <br><br>
            • Intelligent Systems, including data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization, information retrieval, and scientific applications.
            <br><br>
            These academics and research activities find expression through publications in premier international journals and conferences. CSE is also involved in numerous scientific initiatives at the institute, state, national, and international levels, including sponsored research projects, consultancy, government programs, hackathons, journal editorship, workshops, and conferences.
